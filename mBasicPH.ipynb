    "The model extends the ```MBasicInt``` model in the following ways:\n",
    "* **Power and heat markets**: We model power and heat markets with explicit equilibrium constraints in all hours of the model. We introduce this distinction by adding new symbol names rather than introduce a new \"market\" index. We do this because characteristics of the different energy markets differ quite a lot; thus, the advantage of being able to apply some methods to all energy markets is limited. \n",
    "* **Geography**: Generators and consumers may engage in more than one energy market, but they are tied to unique geographic locations. We have separate geographic indices, ```idxGE``` and ```idxGH```, for electricity and heat respectively.\n",
    "* **Trade**: To model trade between geographic areas, we specify trade lines ```idxTrL``` index to indicate trade lines (or transmission lines) between areas. Currently, these are only used for electricity markets (district heat is not traded across significant geographic areas in the same way).\n",
    "* **Plant types:** In MBasicInt the only difference between generators were captured by different parameter values (capacity, costs, variation in productivity). In this model, we introduce different types using an index ```idxPT``` to distinguish between four dominant different types: Standard electricity producing plants (```'stdE'```), standard heat producing plants (```'stdH'```), combined heat and power plants (```'CHP'```), and heat pumper (```'HP'```). This categorical distinction is used to make model generation easier and is identified using a mapping ```idxGen2PT``` (generatior idx maps to unique plant type). "
