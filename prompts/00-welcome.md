# Getting Started with Copilot Chat

**You can ask me to:**
- Validate the current Excel inputs and loader compatibility. 
- Add a generator or consumer class and update dependent variables/mappings. 
- Change time resolution (24 → 168 or 8760).
- Construct new datasets to mimic specific energy systems; the dataset "EX_MBasicInt_CA" is for instance structured to mimic the California system.

**Try:**
- “Run our validation flow #prompts/10-validate-datasets.md”
- “Add an offshore wind tech and map it #prompts/20-add-generator.md”
- “Change the model to 168 hours #prompts/30-change-hours.md”
